# IPChackathon
Anirudh, Sriman, Yug

Added the front-end, a new API for pictures called Unsplash, light-dark mode, celestial.js for the sun (click the sun it gets bigger!), new weather-effects-pixi.js (wanted to get some textures but figured the dots and lines design is more minimalistic), all the files are hella cluttered and disheveled and out of place (tried to make AI write the comments so it maybe a bit easier to understand) will organize tomorrow...still trying to figure out how to get actual clouds instead of squares...(if u didn't search a city and if it's raining or snowing or cloudy there its gonna have a effect) clicking on the temp will change it to C and vice versa.
